# Technology Testing

Repository containing multiple technologies that I am playing with for use in later projects. Each of the technologies sub folders contains `readme` files with useful information about how to start using the particular technology. The samples in this repository are purely educational so if you have things you want to add or change just feel free to do so.

Currently this project has the following technology examples:

## RabbitMQ

Open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol.

The sample project has examples on how to run the different types of queues using RabbitMQ containers. As such we have docker and docker-compose files to control the containers.

## Vault

Vault is a secrets management system  that can be used on prem or in the cloud. The example here shows how to setup  vault to run from a container using the file system for secret storage.

## Python

Python is the most popular programming language for data science. the example here, shows how to run Python in docker, how to build the image automatically with Jenkins and finally how to push the image to Kubernetes running in Minikube.
